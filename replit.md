- July 21, 2025: REDESIGNED project permissions from creator-based to assignee-based ownership model: discovered fundamental conceptual issue where system checked "created_by" but users expect permissions based on "assignee_name", updated canEditProject and canDeleteProject functions to prioritize assignee matching over creator ownership, supports both single assignee names and multi-assignee IDs arrays, ensures users can only edit projects they're assigned to work on rather than projects they originally created
